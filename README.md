Since we know that our mobile phone consists of many sensors which are used for the specific purpose for example like temperature sensor to measure the device temperature so as to take necessary actions to cooling the system and also like accelerometer sensors are used for rotate the screen and also for providing great experience in gaming other sensor like measures the light intensity of surroundings and adjsuts the screen brightness accordingly.What blynk makes us is we can use the accelerometer sensor values in the mobile phone and send it to the node mcu via the blynk server so that we are able to move the robot accordingly.
